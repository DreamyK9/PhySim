# PhySim

I worked on some physics home work once, but got pretty bored. So I though, why not create a physics engine? I love Programming... and Physics. And here it is PhySim, the worlds first physics (and possibly game) engine created by ***me***.

This project is on halt for the moment, as it turned out a bit chaotic. There were multiple issues.
  * First off it was my first attempt at writing something in TypeScript and my knowledge from other languages could only take me so far.
  * In addition I didn't know a lot of the maths involved and only had a pretty basic understanding of it

To fix this I started watching some tutorial videos about the maths involved:
  * [Math for Game Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_eMiFzP5M&list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My) by John Rodriguez
  * [Coding Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpN4NLDpWDY&list=PL7wAPgl1JVvUEb0dIygHzO4698tmcwLk9)

I'm gonna follow it up with a remake at some point in the future. Might also finish up this version with all basic functionalities, as soon as I have an idea about collision and the needed motivation of course.

Update 2024: It's unlikely going to happen anytime soon.
